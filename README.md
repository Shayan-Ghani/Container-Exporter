## üìã Step-by-Step Guide

### Before You start
 - Port 8000 must be open (default port)
 - Docker & Docker Compose should be installed (optional)
 - The presence of Git and Python3.10

### Getting started

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Deploy with Github Actions
- fork the repository.
- go to the fork repository and switch to `Action` tab.
- click the `I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them` button.
- now you have access to all of the workflows, **however make sure you change the secrets listed below accordingly**:
  1. `secretes.DOCKER_TOKEN` : the personal access token docker hub of your(or your organization) account.
  2. `secretes.GHCR_TOKEN` : github classic access token with (packages read:write permissions) or just simply use `${{github.token}}`. [help](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)

*here's how workflows work:*
  - on push to `master` the project will be `built`, `deployed` and `released`.
*since deploying to your servers requires runner configuration it must be triggered manually, you can modify its behavior on `cd.yml` workflow.*
  - on push to any branch **except for** `master` code will be `built` and `healthchecked`
  - on pr the project will be `healthchecked` and `built`.

*double check the required variables and secrets to prevent any unexpected failures*

#### üê≥ Deploy with Docker
- clone and checkout to the repository using the following commands:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Shayan-Ghani/Container-exporter.git
  cd Container-Exporter
```
- Deploy the docker-compose file that suits you the best for instance :
```bash 
# Make the file executable
  chmod +x ./start.sh

# With docker compose v1
  docker-compose -f container-exporter.yml up -d
# Or using v2
  docker compose -f container-exporter.yml up -d
# build from base with Dockerfile
  docker-compose -f container-exporter-local.yml up --build -d
```

#### üêç Can't use Docker? Ok then :
```bash
# No need if done already
  chmod +x ./start.sh

# Set up virtualenv
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -U pip

# Install the required python packages
  pip install -r requirements.txt

# start the initializer script.
  ./start.sh &
``` 

You can use nohup as well : 
```
nohup ./start.sh -out ./nohup.out

# to stop cxp without docker use this command 
kill -9 <PID>
```
Replace `<PID>` with the pid of ./start.sh script.

#### üö¢ Run With A Custom Parameters:

- adjust the following settings for `uvicorn` as environment variables:
  - HOST (Default: 0.0.0.0)
  - PORT (Default: 8000)
  - WORKERS (Default : 3)
  - LOG_LEVEL (Default : warning)

Example:
```bash
PORT="8000" ./start.sh <your custome port> &
```

### üî• Add CXP to Prometheus
- Edit your `prometheus.yml` file and add the address of container-exporter in scrape_configs:

![Prometheus config](./capture/scrape-config.png "Prometheus configuration file")

- Reload or restart your Prometheus server and reach out to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics`
### That is it you are good to go, Enjoy Using CXP! "}"

## üìä Grafana Dashboards
Check out [dashboards](./dashboards) directory for Json files. including CPU & Memory usage + containers status (uptime).

**Change `Your Prometheus data source uid` with the uid of Prometheus data source uid. you can find it this way:** 
- Reach out to Grafana then enter  `Home > Administration > Data sources`  then click on your Prometheus data source.
- the characters after `datasources/edit/` are your uid. (e.g datasources/edit/**c8e586ac-4262-4aad5-a103-1240ss826424**)

- alternatively, use `dashboard-gen.sh` script to change the dashboards' uid by providing the uid as the first argument of the script. do the following steps:

```
 cd scripts && bash dashboard-gen.sh <your uid> 
```
- replace `<your uid>` with your Prometheus datasource uid. 

- now head to Grafana dashboards and hit `new > import` then copy the dashboard Json file and paste it into `Import via panel json`

- hit the `load` button and Done!

## TO-DO
 - [x]  Disk I/O usage 
 - [x]  Network I/O Usage
 - [x]  Add metrics in units of byte
 - [x]  Check and Unregister *stat* metrics for containers that are not running
 - [x]  Enable functionality and smoke testing in ci
 - [ ]  Design grafana dashboards and share them on grafana cloud
 - [ ]  Design and develop a static website to showcase Documentation, new features, etc.
